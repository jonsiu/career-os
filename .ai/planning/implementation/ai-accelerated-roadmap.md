## üõ†Ô∏è AI Development Strategy

### Code Generation Approach
```typescript
// Example: AI can generate complete components with abstractions
// Prompt: "Create a resume upload component with drag-and-drop, 
// PDF/DOCX parsing, and vendor-abstracted database integration"

// AI generates:
// - Complete React component
// - TypeScript interfaces
// - Abstract database operations (works with any provider)
// - Abstract file storage (works with any provider)
// - Error handling
// - Loading states
// - Responsive design
// - Service factory integration
```

### Architecture Decisions
- **Vendor Abstraction First**: Build with abstractions from day one (AI makes this easy)
- **Personal First**: Build features you need, optimize for your workflow
- **Iterative**: Use AI to rapidly iterate based on personal usage
- **Scalable**: Design for multi-user from day one, but prioritize personal use
- **AI-Optimized**: Leverage AI to handle abstraction complexity efficiently

### AI Tools & Workflows
1. **Code Generation**: Use AI for 80% of boilerplate and standard patterns
2. **Architecture Review**: AI validates technical decisions
3. **Testing**: AI generates tests for critical paths
4. **Documentation**: AI maintains up-to-date docs
5. **Debugging**: AI assists with error resolution
6. **Abstraction Management**: AI generates and maintains vendor abstractions
7. **Provider Implementation**: AI creates new vendor implementations quickly
