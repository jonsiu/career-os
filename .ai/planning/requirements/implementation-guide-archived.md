# Values-Driven Implementation Guide for Career OS

This document provides specific examples of how our core values, mindsets, and mental models should influence feature development and copy throughout the Career OS application.

## Current State Analysis

### Issues with Current Copy
Looking at the current application, I've identified several areas where the copy doesn't align with our values:

1. **Fixed Mindset Language**: "Build a compelling resume" implies a one-time achievement
2. **Scarcity Mindset**: "Track applications" focuses on competition rather than growth
3. **Outcome-Only Focus**: "Get personalized analysis" emphasizes results over process
4. **Passion-Finding Language**: Missing the "passion is developed" messaging

## Values-Driven Copy Transformation

### 1. Dashboard Page Transformation

#### Current Copy:
```
"Your personal career development platform. Build your path to success."
"Create and manage your professional resume"
"Build a compelling resume with our step-by-step builder and AI-powered suggestions."
```

#### Values-Aligned Copy:
```
"Your personal career development platform. Grow your skills, build your future."
"Develop and refine your professional story"
"Continuously improve your resume through deliberate practice and growth-focused feedback."
```

### 2. Resume Analysis Feedback Transformation

#### Current Analysis Prompt:
```
"Score this resume on a scale of 1-100 and provide detailed feedback.
Evaluate based on:
1. Content quality and relevance
2. Structure and formatting
3. Keywords and optimization
4. Experience and skills presentation
5. Overall professional presentation"
```

#### Values-Aligned Analysis Prompt:
```
"Analyze this resume from a growth and development perspective, focusing on skill-building opportunities.

Evaluate based on:
1. Skill development potential and career capital building
2. Story coherence and career progression narrative
3. Learning opportunities and growth areas
4. Competency demonstration and mastery indicators
5. Long-term career development alignment

Provide:
- Growth potential assessment (not just current score)
- Skill development recommendations
- Career capital building opportunities
- Deliberate practice suggestions
- Systems for continuous improvement"
```

### 3. Skills Tracking Transformation

#### Current Language:
```
"Track your skills development, learning progress, and career milestones."
"Failed to load skills"
"Could not load your skills. Please try again later."
```

#### Values-Aligned Language:
```
"Build your skill portfolio through deliberate practice and continuous learning."
"Learning opportunity: Let's try loading your skills again"
"Every attempt is progress. Let's explore your skill development journey together."
```
