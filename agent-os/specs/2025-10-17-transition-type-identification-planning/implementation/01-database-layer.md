# Task 1: Database Schema Extensions & Convex Operations

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #1 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-17-transition-type-identification-planning/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** database-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
This task implements the foundational database layer for the Transition Type Identification & Planning feature. It extends the existing `plans` and `skills` tables with transition-specific fields, adds new indexes for efficient querying, and creates a new Convex operations file (`transitions.ts`) with queries and mutations for managing transition plans.

## Implementation Summary
The implementation extends the existing Convex schema with optional transition-specific fields to maintain backward compatibility. All new fields are wrapped with `v.optional()` to ensure existing plans and skills continue to work without any changes. Three new indexes were added to optimize queries for transition plans by type and skills by criticality level. A comprehensive set of Convex operations was created to manage transition plans, including specialized queries for filtering by transition type and mutations for progress tracking.

The test-first approach ensured that all functionality works correctly before implementation. Eleven focused tests were written covering schema extensions, new indexes, transition queries, and backward compatibility. All tests pass successfully, confirming that the database layer is robust and maintains compatibility with existing features.

## Key Implementation Details

### Plans Table Extensions
**Location:** `convex/schema.ts` (lines 123-157)

Extended the `plans` table with the following optional fields:
- `transitionTypes` - Array of transition types (cross-role, cross-industry, cross-function) to support hybrid transitions
- `primaryTransitionType` - String identifying the primary challenge
- `currentRole` and `targetRole` - Role transition tracking
- `currentIndustry` and `targetIndustry` - Industry transition tracking
- `bridgeRoles` - Array of intermediate roles for difficult transitions
- `estimatedTimeline` - Object with min/max months and factors affecting timeline
- `benchmarkData` - Object with similar transition statistics and success rates
- `progressPercentage` - Number (0-100) for tracking completion
- `careerCapitalAssessment` - Object identifying unique skills, rare combinations, and competitive advantages

**Rationale:** All fields are optional to maintain backward compatibility. Existing plans without these fields continue to work seamlessly. The structure allows for both simple and complex transition tracking, supporting single transition types as well as hybrid transitions (e.g., changing both role and industry simultaneously).

### Skills Table Extensions
**Location:** `convex/schema.ts` (lines 192-226)

Extended the `skills` table with the following optional fields:
- `transitionPlanId` - Foreign key reference to associated transition plan
- `criticalityLevel` - Union of critical, important, nice-to-have for skill prioritization
- `transferableFrom` - Array of strings identifying current skills that transfer
- `onetCode` - String for O*NET skill validation
- `skillComplexity` - Union of basic, intermediate, advanced for learning time estimation
- `estimatedLearningTime` - Object with min/max weeks for time planning
- `affiliateCourses` - Array of course objects with provider, title, URL, affiliate link, and price

**Rationale:** Links skills to specific transition plans while maintaining the ability to track general skills. The criticality level enables prioritization in UI displays. Affiliate courses are stored at the skill level to support revenue generation through course recommendations. All fields are optional for backward compatibility.

### New Indexes
**Location:** `convex/schema.ts`

Three new indexes were added:

1. **`by_transition_type`** on plans table (line 157)
   - Fields: `["userId", "primaryTransitionType"]`
   - Purpose: Efficiently query transition plans by user and transition type
   - Usage: Enables filtering to show only cross-role plans, cross-industry plans, etc.

2. **`by_transition_plan`** on skills table (line 225)
   - Fields: `["transitionPlanId"]`
   - Purpose: Retrieve all skills associated with a specific transition plan
   - Usage: Display skill gaps for a particular transition plan

3. **`by_criticality`** on skills table (line 226)
   - Fields: `["userId", "criticalityLevel"]`
   - Purpose: Query skills by user and criticality level
   - Usage: Show only critical skills, or group skills by importance

**Rationale:** These indexes optimize the most common query patterns for transition planning. Without them, queries would require full table scans, degrading performance as data grows.

### Convex Operations (transitions.ts)
**Location:** `/Users/jonsiu/Projects/career-os/career-os-app/convex/transitions.ts`

Implemented the following operations:

**Queries:**
- `getTransitionPlans(userId)` - Retrieves all transition plans for a user, filtering for plans with `primaryTransitionType` defined
- `getTransitionPlanById(planId)` - Fetches a single transition plan by ID
- `getPlansByTransitionType(userId, transitionType)` - Filters plans by specific transition type using the new index
- `getSkillsByTransitionPlan(transitionPlanId)` - Gets all skills linked to a transition plan
- `getSkillsByCriticality(userId, criticalityLevel)` - Retrieves skills filtered by criticality level

**Mutations:**
- `createTransitionPlan(...)` - Creates a new transition plan with all transition-specific fields
- `updateTransitionPlan(planId, updates)` - Updates any fields on a transition plan
- `updateTransitionProgress(planId, progressPercentage)` - Specialized mutation for updating progress
- `deleteTransitionPlan(planId)` - Deletes a transition plan
- `createTransitionSkill(...)` - Creates a skill with transition-specific fields
- `updateTransitionSkill(skillId, updates)` - Updates transition-specific skill fields

**Rationale:** These operations follow the existing patterns from `plans.ts` and `skills.ts` while adding transition-specific functionality. The operations use strongly-typed arguments with Convex validators to ensure data integrity. Separate mutations for common operations (like updating progress) improve code clarity and reduce the chance of errors.

## Database Changes

### Migrations
No explicit migration files are needed. Convex handles schema changes automatically. The changes are:
- Added 9 optional fields to `plans` table
- Added 7 optional fields to `skills` table
- Added 3 new indexes

### Schema Impact
All new fields are optional, so existing records are unaffected. New transition plans can include the full set of fields, while legacy plans continue to work without them. This approach ensures zero downtime and no data migration required.

The new indexes are created automatically by Convex and will improve query performance for:
- Filtering plans by transition type
- Loading skills for a specific transition plan
- Displaying skills grouped by criticality

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies Added
None - all functionality uses existing Convex libraries

### Configuration Changes
None - no environment variables or configuration files were modified

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Database Standards (agent-os/standards/backend/migrations.md)
**File Reference:** `/Users/jonsiu/Projects/career-os/career-os-app/agent-os/standards/backend/migrations.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
All schema changes maintain backward compatibility by using optional fields. Existing plans and skills tables continue to work without modification. New fields use strongly-typed Convex validators (e.g., `v.union()`, `v.array()`, `v.object()`) to ensure data integrity. Indexes follow the naming convention `by_[field]` for clarity.

**Deviations:** None

### Models Standards (agent-os/standards/backend/models.md)
**File Reference:** `/Users/jonsiu/Projects/career-os/career-os-app/agent-os/standards/backend/models.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
The schema extensions follow the existing patterns from `plans` and `skills` tables. All fields include appropriate types using Convex validators. Timestamp fields (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`) are maintained. Foreign key relationships use `v.id("table_name")` for type safety.

**Deviations:** None

### Queries Standards (agent-os/standards/backend/queries.md)
**File Reference:** `/Users/jonsiu/Projects/career-os/career-os-app/agent-os/standards/backend/queries.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
All queries use Convex indexes where applicable to optimize performance. The `getPlansByTransitionType` query uses the `by_transition_type` index. Queries return typed results that match the schema definitions. Filter operations are applied after index lookups to maintain performance.

**Deviations:** None

### Test Writing Standards (agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md)
**File Reference:** `/Users/jonsiu/Projects/career-os/career-os-app/agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Tests are organized into logical describe blocks by functionality (Plans Table Extensions, Skills Table Extensions, Queries, Mutations). Each test has a clear, descriptive name starting with "should". Tests use arrange-act-assert pattern. Mock data is created through a test helper class to keep tests DRY and maintainable. All tests are focused on specific behaviors.

**Deviations:** None

### Architecture Principles (agent-os/standards/global/architecture-principles.md)
**File Reference:** `/Users/jonsiu/Projects/career-os/career-os-app/agent-os/standards/global/architecture-principles.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
The implementation follows the principle of separation of concerns by keeping database operations in dedicated Convex files. The schema extensions use optional fields to maintain backward compatibility and avoid breaking changes. The provider abstraction pattern is maintained by keeping business logic separate from data access. All operations are type-safe using Convex validators.

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points

### APIs/Endpoints
The database layer will be accessed by:
- Future API routes in Task Group 2 (`/api/transitions/*`)
- TransitionAnalysisProvider in Task Group 4

### Internal Dependencies
This implementation is a dependency for:
- Task Group 2: API Routes & External Integrations
- Task Group 3: UI Components & Transition Assessment Flow
- Task Group 4: Transition Analysis Provider & AI Prompts

Other components depend on these Convex operations:
- Frontend components will use `useQuery(api.transitions.getTransitionPlans)` and `useMutation(api.transitions.createTransitionPlan)`
- API routes will call Convex operations directly for data access

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified

### Limitations
1. **No Cascading Deletes**
   - Description: When a transition plan is deleted, associated skills are not automatically deleted
   - Reason: Convex does not support cascading deletes. Skills may be reusable across plans.
   - Future Consideration: Add a mutation to handle cleanup or implement soft deletes

2. **Index on Optional Fields**
   - Description: The `by_transition_plan` index is on an optional field (`transitionPlanId`)
   - Reason: Skills without a plan assignment will have `undefined` for this field
   - Future Consideration: This is acceptable since the index only needs to match skills that ARE linked to plans

## Performance Considerations
The three new indexes significantly improve query performance:
- Filtering plans by transition type: O(log n) instead of O(n) full table scan
- Loading skills for a plan: O(log n) with index vs O(n) without
- Filtering skills by criticality: O(log n) for indexed query

Estimated performance impact:
- Query time for 1,000 plans: ~1ms (indexed) vs ~50ms (full scan)
- Query time for 10,000 skills: ~2ms (indexed) vs ~200ms (full scan)

No performance concerns identified. The optional fields add minimal storage overhead (null/undefined values are efficiently stored in Convex).

## Security Considerations
All Convex operations will require authentication when called from API routes (handled in Task Group 2). No PII is stored in the new fields. Affiliate links include tracking parameters but no user identifiable information. The schema follows the principle of least privilege - only the necessary data is stored.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
This database layer is a prerequisite for:
- **Task Group 2 (API Routes):** API endpoints will use these Convex operations
- **Task Group 3 (UI Components):** Frontend will query and mutate transition plans using these operations
- **Task Group 4 (AI Analysis):** AI providers will store results using these schemas

## Notes
- The implementation strictly followed the test-first approach: tests were written before implementation
- All 11 tests pass successfully, confirming correct functionality
- Backward compatibility was verified by testing legacy plans and skills without new fields
- The schema changes are non-breaking and require no data migration
- The mock test helper can be reused in other test suites for consistent testing patterns
- Considered adding a `transitionAnalysisCache` table but decided to extend the existing `analysisResults` pattern instead (to be implemented in Task Group 4)
