Ok I think we jumped ahead too quickly, let’s nail down the requirements first.

This should be a multi tenant saas application. To start we won’t put any limits on resume uploads or the list of job posts to compare the resume to. For each resume a user can compare it with a list of job posts all of which should match a specific role the user to aiming to get a job in.

The app should act in multiple characters or personas: career coach, HR recruiter, talent manager, and hiring manager. 

Not only should the app help the user tailor their resume for role their aiming to be hired for, but it should also help the user learn, improve and prepare for all parts of the job search and interview process

You're absolutely right! Let's step back and properly define the requirements for a comprehensive multi-tenant SaaS application. This is much more ambitious than what I initially built.

## Technology Stack Recommendations

For a production SaaS application, you'll need:

**Frontend**: React/Next.js or Vue.js with TypeScript
**Backend**: Node.js/Express, Python/Django, or .NET Core
**Database**: PostgreSQL with tenant isolation
**Authentication**: Auth0, Firebase Auth, or custom JWT
**File Storage**: AWS S3 or similar
**AI/ML**: OpenAI API, Anthropic Claude, or custom models
**Deployment**: Docker containers on AWS/GCP/Azure

## Key Questions to Define Scope

1. **Monetization Strategy**: 
   - Freemium vs. paid tiers?
   - Per-resume, per-analysis, or subscription pricing?

2. **AI Integration Depth**:
   - Custom AI models vs. API integration?
   - Real-time analysis vs. batch processing?

3. **User Experience Flow**:
   - How do users switch between personas?
   - Guided workflows vs. free exploration?

4. **Data Sources**:
   - Job board integrations (Indeed, LinkedIn)?
   - Industry salary/trend data sources?

5. **Compliance & Privacy**:
   - GDPR/CCPA compliance requirements?
   - Resume data handling policies?

Would you like me to dive deeper into any of these areas, or should we start by mapping out the user journey and core workflows for the application?
