## Technical Implementation Considerations

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Analysis Results Table
CREATE TABLE resume_analyses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  resume_id UUID REFERENCES resumes(id),
  analysis_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'basic' or 'advanced'
  overall_score INTEGER,
  category_scores JSONB,
  detailed_insights JSONB,
  recommendations JSONB,
  content_hash VARCHAR(64),
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Resume Versions Table
CREATE TABLE resume_versions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  resume_id UUID REFERENCES resumes(id),
  version_number INTEGER,
  content_hash VARCHAR(64),
  changes_summary TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Analysis History Table
CREATE TABLE analysis_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  resume_id UUID REFERENCES resumes(id),
  analysis_id UUID REFERENCES resume_analyses(id),
  version_id UUID REFERENCES resume_versions(id),
  score_change INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Caching Strategy
- **Content Hashing**: Use SHA-256 hash of resume content to detect changes
- **Redis Caching**: Cache analysis results with TTL
- **Database Persistence**: Store all analysis results permanently
- **Cache Invalidation**: Clear cache when resume content changes

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Load analysis results on demand
- **Background Processing**: Run analysis in background for better UX
- **Incremental Updates**: Only re-analyze changed sections when possible
- **CDN Integration**: Cache static analysis components

## Success Metrics
