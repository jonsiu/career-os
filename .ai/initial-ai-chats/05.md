Yes it’s a good start. What I’d like to leverage is some actual data. For example comparing the candidate with the LinkedIn profiles of people in a similar role at the target companies the user is applying to. Would be great to be hooked into a job database as well. Or maybe build a scraper to collect job posts and develop intelligence on specific roles and companies. Are there any large datasets available that would help with this?

Excellent idea! Leveraging real data will make your application incredibly powerful and differentiated. Here are the key data sources and approaches you should consider:

## Job Market Data Sources

### **Public APIs & Datasets**
- **Adzuna API**: Free job search API with salary data and trends
- **JSearch by RapidAPI**: Aggregates jobs from multiple sources
- **Reed.co.uk API**: UK-focused but good for structure reference
- **USAJobs API**: Government positions with detailed requirements
- **GitHub Jobs API**: Tech-focused roles
- **Stack Overflow Jobs**: Developer positions with skill breakdowns

### **LinkedIn Data Challenges & Alternatives**
LinkedIn actively blocks scraping and has strict API limitations, but there are workarounds:
- **Apollo.io API**: Provides LinkedIn profile data legally
- **Hunter.io**: Contact information and basic professional data
- **Clearbit Enrichment**: Company and person data
- **ZoomInfo API**: Professional profiles and company intelligence

### **Academic & Research Datasets**
- **O*NET Database**: Detailed occupational data including skills, education, salary ranges
- **Bureau of Labor Statistics**: Employment statistics, salary ranges, job growth projections
- **Glassdoor API**: Company reviews, salaries, interview questions
- **Payscale API**: Salary data with skill breakdowns

## Scraping & Data Collection Strategy

### **Job Board Scraping**
```
Target Sites:
- Indeed (largest volume)
- Glassdoor (company insights)
- AngelList (startup roles)
- Dice (tech roles)
- Monster (diverse industries)
- Company career pages directly
```

### **What to Extract**
- Job titles and variations
- Required vs. preferred skills
- Education requirements
- Experience levels
- Salary ranges
- Company size/industry
- Location preferences
- Benefits packages
- Team structure mentions

### **Profile Intelligence**
From public sources, extract:
- Career progression patterns
- Skill combinations that lead to promotions
- Education backgrounds of successful candidates
- Geographic movement patterns
- Company transition patterns

## Technical Implementation Approach

### **Data Pipeline Architecture**
1. **Collection Layer**: Scrapers + APIs collecting job/profile data
2. **Processing Layer**: NLP for skill extraction, normalization, categorization
3. **Intelligence Layer**: ML models for pattern recognition and recommendations
4. **Application Layer**: Your SaaS serving insights to users

### **Key Datasets to Build**
1. **Role Taxonomy**: Standardized job titles and career paths
2. **Skill Graphs**: Which skills cluster together, progression paths
3. **Company Intelligence**: Hiring patterns, preferred backgrounds
4. **Compensation Data**: Salary ranges by role/location/experience
5. **Interview Intelligence**: Common questions by role/company

## Specific Intelligence You Could Provide

### **Career Coach Persona**
- "People who got promoted from your current role to your target role typically added these 3 skills"
- "Your experience level is in the 70th percentile for this role"
- "Career paths from your background typically follow this trajectory"

### **HR Recruiter Persona**
- "This company typically requires X years more experience than you have"
- "Your resume is missing 3 of the top 5 keywords for this role"
- "Similar candidates at this company have these educational backgrounds"

### **Talent Manager Persona**  
- "Top performers in this role at similar companies emphasize these competencies"
- "Your quantified achievements compare favorably to the 85th percentile"
- "This role requires demonstrated experience in [specific areas you're missing]"

### **Hiring Manager Persona**
- "Based on this company's recent hires, they prefer candidates with [specific combination]"
- "Your background matches 75% of successful candidates in similar roles"
- "This hiring manager typically asks about [specific technical areas]"

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

- Respect robots.txt and rate limiting
- Use proper attribution for public data
- Consider data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Be transparent about data sources with users
- Implement data retention policies

## Starting Point Recommendation

I'd suggest starting with:
1. **O*NET + BLS data** for role/skill foundations
2. **Adzuna API** for current job market trends  
3. **A focused scraper** for 2-3 major job boards
4. **Apollo.io or similar** for profile intelligence
