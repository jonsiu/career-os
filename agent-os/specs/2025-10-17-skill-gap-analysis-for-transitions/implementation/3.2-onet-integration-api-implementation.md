# Task 3.2: O*NET Integration API Endpoints

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task Group 3.2 from `/Users/jonsiu/Projects/career-os/career-os-app/agent-os/specs/2025-10-17-skill-gap-analysis-for-transitions/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Implement API endpoints for O*NET occupational data integration, enabling users to search occupations and retrieve detailed skill requirements from the O*NET database with proper caching and rate limiting.

## Implementation Summary
Created three RESTful API endpoints that integrate with the O*NET provider to deliver occupational data to the frontend. The implementation leverages the existing O*NET provider (located at `/Users/jonsiu/Projects/career-os/career-os-app/src/lib/abstractions/providers/onet-provider.ts`) which was already created by another team member, and wraps it with authenticated API routes following CareerOS patterns.

All endpoints require Clerk authentication, implement proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes, and utilize the 30-day caching layer built into the O*NET provider to minimize redundant external API calls. The implementation follows RESTful conventions and matches the error handling patterns from existing analysis API routes.

## Key Implementation Details

### GET /api/onet/search Endpoint
**Location:** `/Users/jonsiu/Projects/career-os/career-os-app/src/app/api/onet/search/route.ts`

Implements occupation search functionality with the following features:
- Required query parameter validation (returns 400 if missing)
- Clerk authentication requirement (returns 401 if unauthorized)
- Calls `ONetProvider.searchOccupations(query)` method
- Implements pagination limiting results to 20 occupations maximum per spec
- Returns structured response with `{ success, occupations[], count, total }`
- Comprehensive error handling for rate limits (429), timeouts (504), and server errors (500)

**Rationale:** Search is the entry point for users to discover target roles, so pagination prevents overwhelming results while the query parameter enables flexible occupation discovery.

### GET /api/onet/occupation/[code] Endpoint
**Location:** `/Users/jonsiu/Projects/career-os/career-os-app/src/app/api/onet/occupation/[code]/route.ts`

Retrieves complete occupation details including skills, knowledge areas, abilities, and labor market data:
- Dynamic route parameter for O*NET SOC code (e.g., "15-1252.00")
- Explicit cache checking via `getCachedOccupation(code)` before API call
- Falls back to `getOccupationSkills(code)` if cache miss
- Automatically caches results via `cacheOccupation(code, data)` for 30-day TTL
- Returns cache status in response (`cached: boolean`) for debugging
- Returns 404 for invalid/not found occupation codes
- Handles API unavailability with 503 status and fallback messaging

**Rationale:** Complete occupation data is needed for comprehensive skill gap analysis, and explicit cache handling ensures minimal O*NET API usage while providing fresh data when needed.

### GET /api/onet/skills/[code] Endpoint
**Location:** `/Users/jonsiu/Projects/career-os/career-os-app/src/app/api/onet/skills/[code]/route.ts`

Optimized endpoint returning only skills array (subset of full occupation details):
- Same caching strategy as occupation endpoint
- Returns only `skills[]`, `occupationCode`, `occupationTitle`, and `cached` fields
- Reduces payload size for skill gap analysis consumption
- Uses same error handling patterns as occupation endpoint

**Rationale:** Skill gap analysis primarily needs skill requirements, not full occupation details. This optimized endpoint reduces response payload and improves performance for the primary use case.

### Test Suite
**Location:** `/Users/jonsiu/Projects/career-os/career-os-app/src/app/api/onet/__tests__/onet-api.test.ts`

Comprehensive test coverage including:
- Search endpoint with valid query returns 200 and occupation array
- Search endpoint without query returns 400 error
- Search endpoint without authentication returns 401 error
- Occupation endpoint with valid code returns 200 and full occupation data
- Occupation endpoint with invalid code returns 404 error
- Skills endpoint returns only skills subset
- Cache integration test verifies provider methods called correctly

**Rationale:** Tests cover critical user flows (search → details), authentication requirements, input validation, and error scenarios per task requirements.

## Database Changes
No database changes were made in this task. The `onetCache` table and operations were created in Task Group 1.1 (database foundation layer) and are utilized through the O*NET provider abstraction.

## Dependencies

### Existing Dependencies Used
- `@clerk/nextjs/server` (auth) - For user authentication
- `next/server` (NextRequest, NextResponse) - For API route handling
- `/Users/jonsiu/Projects/career-os/career-os-app/src/lib/abstractions/providers/onet-provider.ts` - O*NET provider implementation (created in Task Group 2.1, already exists in codebase)

### Configuration Changes
None required. O*NET API credentials are expected to be configured via environment variables:
- `ONET_API_USERNAME` - O*NET Web Services username (optional, provider falls back to mock data)
- `ONET_API_PASSWORD` - O*NET Web Services password (optional, provider falls back to mock data)

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `/Users/jonsiu/Projects/career-os/career-os-app/src/app/api/onet/__tests__/onet-api.test.ts` - All O*NET API endpoint tests

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Complete (7 test cases covering critical paths)
- Integration tests: ✅ Complete (cache layer integration tested)
- Edge cases covered:
  - Missing query parameter
  - Unauthorized access
  - Invalid occupation code
  - Cache hit vs cache miss scenarios
  - API error handling (rate limits, timeouts, not found)

### Manual Testing Performed
API endpoints can be manually tested using:
```bash
# Search occupations
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <clerk-token>" \
  "http://localhost:3000/api/onet/search?query=software"

# Get occupation details
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <clerk-token>" \
  "http://localhost:3000/api/onet/occupation/15-1252.00"

# Get occupation skills only
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <clerk-token>" \
  "http://localhost:3000/api/onet/skills/15-1252.00"
```

## Integration Points

### APIs/Endpoints
- `GET /api/onet/search?query={query}` - Search occupations
  - Request: Query string parameter
  - Response: `{ success: true, occupations: [{ code, title, description }], count, total }`

- `GET /api/onet/occupation/[code]` - Get occupation details
  - Request: O*NET SOC code in URL path
  - Response: `{ success: true, occupation: OccupationSkills, cached: boolean }`

- `GET /api/onet/skills/[code]` - Get occupation skills
  - Request: O*NET SOC code in URL path
  - Response: `{ success: true, skills: ONetSkill[], occupationCode, occupationTitle, cached }`

### External Services
- O*NET Web Services API (via ONetProviderImpl)
  - Rate limit: 5 requests/second
  - Authentication: Basic auth with username/password
  - Caching: 30-day TTL in Convex `onetCache` table

### Internal Dependencies
- `ONetProviderImpl` from `/Users/jonsiu/Projects/career-os/career-os-app/src/lib/abstractions/providers/onet-provider.ts`
- Convex `onetCache` table (via provider)
- Clerk authentication middleware

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified at this time.

### Limitations
1. **O*NET API Credentials Optional**
   - Description: If O*NET credentials not configured, provider falls back to mock data
   - Reason: Enables development/testing without O*NET account
   - Future Consideration: May want to fail loudly in production if credentials missing

2. **Search Pagination Fixed at 20 Results**
   - Description: Search always returns max 20 results, no support for offset/page parameters
   - Reason: Spec requirement keeps MVP simple
   - Future Consideration: Add offset/limit query parameters for more results

3. **No Response Caching Headers**
   - Description: API routes don't set Cache-Control or ETag headers
   - Reason: Cache-Control not critical for MVP, provider handles data caching
   - Future Consideration: Add appropriate cache headers to reduce frontend requests

## Performance Considerations
- O*NET provider implements 30-day TTL cache reducing external API calls by 85%+ (target)
- Rate limiting (5 req/sec) enforced by provider to prevent API throttling
- Pagination limits search results to 20 max, preventing large payloads
- Skills endpoint returns subset of data (optimization for skill gap analysis)
- Cache status included in response for monitoring cache hit rate

## Security Considerations
- All endpoints require Clerk authentication (no public access)
- O*NET API credentials stored in environment variables (not in code)
- No PII sent to O*NET API (only occupation codes and search queries)
- Error messages don't expose internal system details or API keys
- Invalid input returns appropriate 400 errors before reaching provider

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
- **Task Group 3.1 (Skill Gap Analysis API)**: Will use `/api/onet/skills/[code]` to fetch target role requirements
- **Task Group 4.1 (Analysis Wizard)**: Will use `/api/onet/search` for occupation autocomplete
- **Task Group 4.2 (Visualizations)**: May use occupation details for context in UI

## Notes
- The O*NET provider implementation was already created and includes comprehensive error handling, caching, and rate limiting. This task focused on exposing that functionality through authenticated API routes.
- Mock data fallback in provider is useful for development but should be monitored in production logs to ensure real O*NET data being used.
- Future enhancement: Consider adding webhook for O*NET database version updates to invalidate cache when new version released.
- Cache hit rate should be monitored after initial warmup period to validate 85%+ target from spec.
