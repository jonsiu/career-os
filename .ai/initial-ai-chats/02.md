## Building Your Resume Builder Web Application

I've created a React-based resume builder application that you can run locally on your machine. Here's an overview of what I've built for you:

### Application Overview

The application is a full-featured resume builder that:

1. **Guides users through building a resume** with a step-by-step interface
2. **Analyzes job descriptions** to compare with your resume
3. **Provides optimization suggestions** to tailor your resume for specific jobs
4. **Saves resume data locally** in the browser's storage

### Key Features

- **Multi-step form** covering all essential resume sections
- **Real-time preview** of how your resume will look
- **Resume analysis engine** that identifies:
  - Skills found in your resume that match the job description
  - Potential missing skills from the job description
  - Match rates for each experience section
  - Overall resume-to-job match percentage
- **Improvement suggestions** based on the analysis
- **Local storage** to save and load resume data

### Technology Used

- **React** for the user interface and state management
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Browser localStorage** for data persistence

### How to Set Up and Run Locally

I've created detailed setup instructions in the attached artifact. The setup process is straightforward and involves:

1. Creating a new React application
2. Installing Tailwind CSS
3. Adding the ResumeBuilder component
4. Starting the development server

No backend is required as everything runs in the browser with data stored locally.

### Future Enhancements

Once you have the basic application running, you could consider adding:

1. **Export functionality** (PDF, DOCX)
2. **Multiple resume templates**
3. **More advanced AI analysis** by integrating with external APIs
4. **Cloud storage** with a simple backend
5. **Job application tracking**

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the code in more detail, or would you like guidance on how to implement any of the suggested enhancements?
