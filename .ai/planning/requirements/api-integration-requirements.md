## Technical Implementation

### **API Abstraction Layer**
```typescript
interface APIProvider {
  name: string;
  baseURL: string;
  rateLimit: RateLimit;
  authentication: AuthenticationMethod;
  endpoints: Endpoint[];
}

interface RateLimit {
  requests: number;
  period: 'hour' | 'day' | 'month';
  burst?: number;
}

interface AuthenticationMethod {
  type: 'none' | 'api_key' | 'oauth' | 'bearer';
  credentials?: Credentials;
}
```

### **API Health Monitoring**
```typescript
interface APIHealthMonitor {
  checkHealth: (provider: APIProvider) => Promise<HealthStatus>;
  getUsage: (provider: APIProvider) => Promise<UsageStats>;
  handleRateLimit: (provider: APIProvider) => Promise<void>;
  fallback: (provider: APIProvider) => Promise<AlternativeProvider>;
}
```

### **Data Caching Strategy**
```typescript
interface APICache {
  cache: Map<string, CachedData>;
  ttl: number;
  maxSize: number;
  evictionPolicy: 'lru' | 'fifo' | 'ttl';
}
```

## Cost Optimization

### **Free Tier Prioritization**
1. **O*NET API**: No limits, highest priority
2. **BLS API**: No limits, highest priority
3. **GitHub API**: 5000 requests/hour, high priority
4. **Hugging Face API**: 1000 requests/month, medium priority
5. **Coursera API**: 1000 requests/day, medium priority

### **Rate Limit Management**
- Implement exponential backoff for rate-limited APIs
- Use multiple API keys where possible
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Implement request queuing for burst handling

### **Fallback Strategies**
- Multiple data sources for redundancy
- Cached data for offline functionality
- Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- User notification for service disruptions

## Success Metrics

### **API Integration Success**
- API uptime > 99.5%
- Response time < 2 seconds
- Data accuracy > 95%
- Cost per request < $0.01

### **User Experience Impact**
