# Values-Driven Implementation Plan for Career OS

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a comprehensive transformation of Career OS to align with our core values: Growth Mindset, Abundance Mindset, Deep Work principles, and Systems Thinking. The implementation is structured in three phases, prioritizing high-impact changes that will immediately improve user experience and long-term engagement.

## Current State Analysis

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **Fixed Mindset Language Throughout**
   - "Build a compelling resume" (one-time achievement focus)
   - "Get personalized analysis" (outcome-only focus)
   - "Track applications" (competitive scarcity mindset)

2. **Missing Growth-Oriented Features**
   - No skill development journey visualization
   - No deliberate practice tracking
   - No compound growth visualization
   - No systems thinking implementation

3. **Analysis Prompts Don't Align with Values**
   - Current prompts focus on scoring rather than growth
   - Missing Cal Newport's "passion is developed" messaging
   - No emphasis on career capital building

4. **Research-Based Analysis vs. Values Integration**
   - Strong research foundation exists but needs values integration
   - Analysis focuses on recruiter perspective rather than user growth
   - Missing abundance mindset in opportunity exploration

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Updates

ALTER TABLE skills ADD COLUMN mastery_level VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'novice';
ALTER TABLE skills ADD COLUMN growth_velocity DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE skills ADD COLUMN compound_growth_factor DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 1.0;
ALTER TABLE skills ADD COLUMN last_practice_date TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE skills ADD COLUMN practice_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

#### New Tables
```sql
-- Career Capital Tracking
CREATE TABLE career_capital (
  id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  skill_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  rarity_score INTEGER NOT NULL,
  market_value DECIMAL(10,2),
  accumulated_hours INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Deliberate Practice Sessions
CREATE TABLE practice_sessions (
  id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  skill_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  duration_minutes INTEGER NOT NULL,
  focus_level INTEGER NOT NULL, -- 1-10 scale
  session_quality INTEGER NOT NULL, -- 1-10 scale
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### API Endpoint Updates

#### Enhanced Analysis Endpoint
