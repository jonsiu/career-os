## 🔄 Document Updates

### **Living Documents**
All documents are living documents that should be updated as:
- Requirements evolve
- Technical decisions change
- User feedback is collected
- Market conditions shift
- Vendor strategies change

### **Version Control**
- Documents are version controlled with Git
- Major changes should include rationale and impact assessment
- Update timestamps when documents are modified

### **Collaboration**
- Use comments and suggestions for collaborative editing
- Tag team members for review when appropriate
- Maintain document ownership and review cycles

## 📊 Document Status

### **Current Status**
- ✅ **Vision**: Complete and ready for development
- ✅ **Requirements**: Complete feature specifications
- ✅ **Architecture**: Complete technical design with vendor abstractions
- ✅ **Implementation**: Complete development roadmap
- ✅ **Process**: Complete workflow documentation
- 🔄 **Future**: Planning in progress

### **Next Steps**
1. **Week 1-2**: Project setup and Convex integration with abstractions
2. **Week 3-4**: Resume management and file storage with vendor flexibility
3. **Week 5-6**: Job posting system and analysis engine with multiple providers
4. **Week 7-8**: Career Coach persona and development planning
5. **Week 9-10**: Polish, testing, and deployment with vendor optimization

## 🎯 Key Principles

### **Documentation Standards**
- Clear, concise writing
- Actionable information
- Visual organization with headers and lists
- Code examples where relevant
- Links between related documents

### **Planning Philosophy**
- User-first development approach
- Iterative improvement cycles
- Data-driven decision making
- Scalable architecture from day one
- Vendor-independent design
- Quality over speed

### **Success Metrics**
- Clear success criteria for each phase
- Measurable outcomes and KPIs
- User feedback integration
- Technical performance benchmarks
- Business impact assessment
- Vendor flexibility and cost optimization

## 🔄 **Architecture Evolution**

### **Original Approach**
- Tightly coupled to Convex ecosystem
- Vendor lock-in to specific providers
- Limited flexibility for cost optimization

### **Current Approach**
- Vendor abstraction interfaces
- Service factory pattern
- Multi-vendor support
- Gradual migration capability
- Cost optimization flexibility

This planning structure provides a comprehensive foundation for building CareerOS while maintaining clarity and organization as the project grows, with the added benefit of vendor independence and flexibility.
