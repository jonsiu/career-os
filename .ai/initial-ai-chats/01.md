I want to build a web application that help me build a job-winning resume. It should ask me questions about my job experience and then build out a full resume. It should allow a user to post in a job description, compare the job description to my resume and then make suggestions on how to improve my resume, or ask me questions to get more information about my work experience to add to or improve my resume.

How should I go about building this web application? I just need to run it locally on my machine to start

# Resume Builder Web Application

To build a local web application for creating and optimizing job-winning resumes, I'd recommend starting with a simple but effective approach. Here's a plan for developing this application:

## Technology Stack Recommendation

For a local application that's easy to set up and maintain, I recommend:

1. **Frontend**: React for the user interface
2. **Backend**: Express.js (Node.js) for handling data
3. **Local Storage**: Either browser localStorage or a simple JSON file for storing resume data

This stack is lightweight, widely used, and perfect for running locally.

## Core Features to Implement

1. **Resume Builder** - Step-by-step form to collect:
   - Personal information
   - Education history
   - Work experience
   - Skills
   - Projects/achievements
   - References

2. **Job Description Analyzer** - Allow users to:
   - Paste job descriptions
   - Compare job requirements with resume content
   - Highlight matching skills/experiences
   - Identify gaps

3. **Resume Optimization** - Provide:
   - Tailored recommendations for improving match rates
   - Suggestions for keyword optimization
   - Follow-up questions to extract more relevant experiences

## Implementation Approach

Let me create a basic React application that demonstrates this concept. I'll focus on the core functionality first.
