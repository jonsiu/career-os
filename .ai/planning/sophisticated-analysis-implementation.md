# Sophisticated Resume Analysis Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented a much more sophisticated resume analysis system based on academic research from HR and recruitment studies. This goes far beyond the simple keyword matching that was previously implemented.

## Research Foundation

### Key Academic Sources Implemented

1. **"The Resume Research Literature: Where Have We Been and Where Should We Go Next?"**
   - Comprehensive review of resume research
   - Identifies key factors in resume evaluation
   - Highlights importance of work experience, even if unrelated to job

2. **"A Framework for Résumé Decisions: Comparing Applicants' and Employers' Reasons"**
   - Structured framework for understanding decision-making processes
   - Compares applicant and employer perspectives
   - Identifies alignment and discrepancies

3. **"Improving Employee Selection With a Revised Resume Format"**
   - Evidence-based recommendations for resume structure
   - Impact of format modifications on selection process
   - Standardized resume benefits

4. **"An Analysis of Effective Resume Content, Format, and Appearance Based on College Recruiter Perceptions"**
   - Recruiter preferences and evaluation criteria
   - Content and formatting impact on evaluations
   - Professional presentation standards
