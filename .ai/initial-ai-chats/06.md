Thatâ€™s a great start. Ideally we just use whatever datasets are free to use. For anything that has costs we would add on later when we have paying customers.

Perfect approach! Let's focus on building a solid foundation with free data sources, then layer on paid services as you scale.

## Free Data Sources to Start With

### **Government & Academic Sources (100% Free)**
- **O*NET Database**: Comprehensive occupational data, skills, education requirements, salary ranges
- **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)**: Employment statistics, job growth projections, median wages
- **Census Bureau**: Industry and occupation data
- **Department of Education**: Education requirements by field

### **Free APIs & Datasets**
- **USAJobs API**: Government positions (great for understanding role requirements)
- **GitHub Jobs API**: Tech roles with detailed skill requirements
- **Stack Overflow Jobs**: Developer positions (good skill breakdown examples)
- **Common Crawl**: Web crawl data (can extract job postings)
- **Kaggle Datasets**: Various HR/recruitment datasets uploaded by community

### **Scrapeable Public Sources**
- **Company career pages**: Direct from source, often most accurate
- **University career centers**: Entry-level role requirements
- **Professional association websites**: Industry standards and certifications
- **Government contractor sites**: Detailed role specifications
- **Open source job board repos**: Some maintain public datasets

## High-Value Free Scraping Targets

### **Job Boards with Generous Terms**
```
Primary Targets:
- AngelList/Wellfound (startup jobs, often detailed)
- Remote.co (remote positions)
- WeWorkRemotely (remote jobs)
- Authentic Jobs (creative roles)
- Dice (tech, often very detailed requirements)
```

### **Company Direct Sources**
```
High-Value Targets:
- Fortune 500 career pages
- Fast-growing companies (YC portfolio, etc.)
- Government contractors (very detailed requirements)
- Universities (academic and administrative roles)
```

## MVP Data Architecture

### **Phase 1: Foundation Data (Free)**
1. **Role Taxonomy**: Build from O*NET + BLS data
2. **Skills Database**: Extract from government sources + scraped job posts
3. **Salary Baselines**: BLS data as foundation
4. **Education Requirements**: Government + university sources

### **Phase 2: Market Intelligence (Free Scraping)**
1. **Current Job Market**: Scrape 3-5 job boards weekly
2. **Company Patterns**: Track hiring patterns from career pages
3. **Skill Trends**: Monitor which skills are trending up/down
4. **Geographic Insights**: Location-based role variations

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Intelligence (When You Have Revenue)**
1. **LinkedIn insights** via Apollo.io or similar
2. **Glassdoor integration** for company culture/interview data
3. **Premium job APIs** for broader coverage
4. **Salary APIs** for real-time compensation data

## Implementation Strategy

### **Week 1-2: Data Foundation**
```python
# Example data pipeline start
- Set up O*NET data ingestion
- Build role/skill taxonomy
- Create job posting scraper framework
- Set up basic data processing pipeline
```

### **Week 3-4: Intelligence Layer**
```python
# Basic analysis capabilities
- Skill extraction from job posts
- Role requirement standardization
- Basic matching algorithms
- Trend analysis framework
```

### **Week 5-6: Application Integration**
```python
# Connect to your SaaS app
- API endpoints for data access
- Real-time analysis capabilities
- Persona-based insights generation
```

## Specific Free Datasets to Download

### **O*NET Interest Profiler Data**
- 22 million+ job characteristics
- Skills, education, experience requirements
- Updated regularly by Department of Labor

### **BLS Occupational Employment Statistics**
- Salary data by occupation and location
- Employment projections
- Industry concentration data

### **Common Crawl Job Posting Extracts**
- Historical job posting data
- Good for training ML models
- Massive scale (petabytes)

## Legal & Technical Considerations

### **Scraping Best Practices**
- Start with robots.txt compliant sites
- Use reasonable delays (1-2 seconds between requests)
- Rotate user agents and IP addresses
- Focus on sites with generous terms of service

### **Data Quality Strategy**
- Implement deduplication algorithms
- Build data validation rules
- Create feedback loops for accuracy
- Monitor for schema changes

## Quick Win: MVP Data Sources

To get started immediately, I'd recommend:

1. **Download O*NET database** (complete occupational data)
2. **Set up BLS API integration** (salary/employment data)
3. **Build scrapers for 2-3 job boards** (current market data)
4. **Create basic role/skill taxonomy** from government data

This gives you a solid foundation to start providing real insights to users without any ongoing costs.
