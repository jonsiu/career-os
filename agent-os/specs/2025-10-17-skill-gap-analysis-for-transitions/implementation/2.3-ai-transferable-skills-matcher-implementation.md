# Task 2.3: AI Transferable Skills Matcher

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #2.3 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-17-skill-gap-analysis-for-transitions/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Implement an AI-powered transferable skills matcher that analyzes how skills transfer between career roles. The service uses Claude/GPT-4 to identify non-obvious skill transfers, provides confidence scoring on a 0-1 scale, and falls back to O*NET baseline matching if AI analysis fails or times out.

## Implementation Summary
I implemented a comprehensive TransferableSkillsMatcher service that intelligently identifies transferable skills between current and target roles using AI-powered analysis. The implementation follows CareerOS patterns and includes robust error handling, caching, and fallback mechanisms.

The core approach uses a server-side API route pattern (to protect API keys) with a 30-second timeout for AI analysis. If the AI service fails or times out, the system gracefully degrades to an O*NET baseline skill overlap detection algorithm that uses exact and partial string matching.

The service implements skill pair caching to reduce costs and improve performance, and provides both bulk analysis (findTransferableSkills) and individual skill explanation (explainTransfer) capabilities.

## Key Implementation Details

### TransferableSkillsMatcher Service
**Location:** `src/lib/services/transferable-skills-matcher.ts`

The TransferableSkillsMatcher service is the core implementation that provides three main methods:

1. **findTransferableSkills()** - Analyzes transferable skills between current and target roles
   - Takes current skills from resume and target skills from O*NET
   - Constructs AI prompt with role context
   - Calls server-side API with 30-second timeout
   - Caches results by skill pair hash
   - Falls back to O*NET baseline on failure

2. **explainTransfer()** - Provides detailed explanation for individual skill transfers
   - Explains how a specific skill transfers between contexts
   - Returns explanation with confidence score
   - Used for drill-down analysis

3. **calculateTransferConfidence()** - Calculates confidence scores (0-1 scale)
   - Combines skill level factor (30%)
   - Applicability factor (50%)
   - Explanation strength factor (20%)
   - Clamps to 0-1 range

**Rationale:** This design separates concerns between bulk analysis and individual explanations, allowing the UI to lazy-load detailed explanations while providing quick overview results.

### AI Prompt Template
**Location:** `src/lib/services/transferable-skills-matcher.ts` (buildAIPrompt method)

The AI prompt is carefully structured to guide Claude/GPT-4 to analyze four types of skill transfers:
1. Direct skill overlap (same skill, different context)
2. Adjacent skills (e.g., Python → JavaScript for developers)
3. Meta-skills (e.g., Project Management → Leadership)
4. Domain knowledge transfer (e.g., Finance domain → FinTech roles)

The prompt requests JSON output with specific fields: skillName, currentLevel, applicabilityToTarget, transferRationale, and confidence (0-1 scale).

**Rationale:** Structured JSON output ensures consistent parsing and validation. The four-category analysis framework helps the AI consider multiple dimensions of transferability beyond obvious direct matches.

### O*NET Baseline Fallback
**Location:** `src/lib/services/transferable-skills-matcher.ts` (performBaselineAnalysis method)

The baseline algorithm uses string similarity matching:
- Exact match: 1.0 confidence
- Contains match: 0.9 confidence
- Word overlap (Jaccard similarity): calculated dynamically

Skills with >0.5 similarity are considered transferable.

**Rationale:** This ensures the system remains functional even if AI services are unavailable, providing a degraded but usable experience. The Jaccard similarity algorithm is simple, fast, and works well for skill name matching.

### Caching Strategy
**Location:** `src/lib/services/transferable-skills-matcher.ts` (skillPairCache Map)

Results are cached in-memory by a hash of: currentRole + targetRole + currentSkills + targetSkills.

**Rationale:** Skill transfer analysis for the same role pair is deterministic enough that caching significantly reduces API costs and latency. The in-memory cache is sufficient for MVP; future implementations could persist to database.

### Validation and Error Handling
**Location:** `src/lib/services/transferable-skills-matcher.ts` (validateAIResponse method)

All AI responses are validated to ensure:
- transferableSkills array exists and is an array
- Each skill has required fields (skillName, currentLevel, applicabilityToTarget, transferRationale, confidence)
- Numeric values are clamped to valid ranges (0-100 for levels, 0-1 for confidence)

Invalid responses return empty results rather than throwing errors, allowing graceful degradation.

**Rationale:** AI responses can be unpredictable. Defensive validation prevents runtime errors and provides clear fallback behavior.

## Database Changes (if applicable)

No database changes were required for this implementation. The service operates at the application layer and delegates to API routes for server-side AI calls.

## Dependencies (if applicable)

### New Dependencies Added
None - the implementation uses existing dependencies (fetch API, TypeScript standard library).

### Configuration Changes
The service expects two API endpoints to be implemented in Phase 3:
- `POST /api/skill-gap/transferable-skills` - Bulk AI analysis endpoint
- `POST /api/skill-gap/explain-transfer` - Individual skill explanation endpoint

These endpoints will handle the actual Anthropic Claude API integration server-side.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### agent-os/standards/backend/api.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/backend/api.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The TransferableSkillsMatcher service delegates to server-side API routes for AI integration, protecting API keys from client exposure. All AI calls use POST methods with JSON payloads, following RESTful patterns. Error handling returns structured responses rather than throwing exceptions, allowing graceful degradation.

**Deviations (if any):** None

### agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The service implements comprehensive try-catch blocks around AI API calls, with fallback to O*NET baseline on failures. User-facing errors are descriptive (e.g., "AI analysis failed, falling back to O*NET baseline"). The validateAIResponse method ensures malformed responses don't crash the application. Confidence scores include an explanation strength analyzer that accounts for weak language in AI responses.

**Deviations (if any):** None

### agent-os/standards/global/logging-observability.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/logging-observability.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The service includes console.log statements for cache hits, console.warn for AI failures, and console.error for unexpected errors. These logs provide visibility into service behavior and help debug issues. Future enhancements could integrate with Sentry or DataDog as mentioned in the spec.

**Deviations (if any):** None

### agent-os/standards/global/performance-basics.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/performance-basics.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The implementation includes in-memory caching of skill pair results to reduce redundant AI API calls. The 30-second timeout prevents hanging requests. The baseline fallback algorithm uses efficient Jaccard similarity (O(n) complexity) rather than expensive fuzzy matching. The service is designed to be imported and instantiated once, avoiding repeated initialization overhead.

**Deviations (if any):** None

### agent-os/standards/backend/api-routes.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/backend/api-routes.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
While this task focuses on the service layer, the design anticipates server-side API routes that will follow CareerOS patterns: Clerk authentication, proper HTTP status codes (400 for validation, 401 for auth, 500 for server errors), and JSON response formatting. The service methods are designed to be easily consumed by API route handlers.

**Deviations (if any):** None

### agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
All 8 tests follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert). Mock implementations use jest.fn() for fetch API. Tests are focused on critical paths (AI integration, fallback logic, validation). Each test has a clear, descriptive name explaining what is being tested. Edge cases like malformed responses and timeouts are explicitly covered.

**Deviations (if any):** None

## Integration Points (if applicable)

### APIs/Endpoints
This service will integrate with the following endpoints (to be implemented in Task Group 3.1):

- `POST /api/skill-gap/transferable-skills` - Bulk AI analysis
  - Request format: `{ currentSkills[], targetSkills[], currentRole, targetRole, prompt }`
  - Response format: `{ transferableSkills[], transferPatterns[] }`
  - Server-side Anthropic Claude API integration with claude-3-5-sonnet model

  - Response format: `{ explanation, confidence }`
  - Server-side Anthropic Claude API integration

### External Services
- Anthropic Claude API (claude-3-5-sonnet model) - for AI-powered skill transfer analysis
- Server-side integration to protect API keys
- 30-second timeout to prevent hanging requests

### Internal Dependencies
- O*NET Provider (Task Group 2.1) - provides target skill data
- Resume Analysis Provider - provides current skill extraction (existing)
- None of these dependencies are directly called from this service; they flow through the API endpoints

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified at this time. All tests pass successfully.

### Limitations
1. **In-Memory Cache**
   - Description: Skill pair cache is in-memory only, not persisted
   - Reason: Simplifies MVP implementation
   - Future Consideration: Persist cache to database (Convex table) for cross-session reuse

2. **Single AI Model**
   - Description: Currently designed for Claude/GPT-4; no multi-model support
   - Reason: MVP focuses on single AI provider
   - Future Consideration: Add provider abstraction to support multiple AI models (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.)

3. **No Streaming Support**
   - Description: AI responses are not streamed; user waits for full response
   - Reason: Streaming adds complexity; noted as "optional for MVP" in spec
   - Future Consideration: Implement streaming for real-time feedback on long analyses

## Performance Considerations
- **Caching:** In-memory cache reduces redundant AI API calls for identical skill pairs, saving ~$0.02-0.10 per analysis
- **Timeout:** 30-second timeout prevents hanging requests and ensures user experience doesn't degrade
- **Baseline Fallback:** O(n²) string comparison is acceptable for typical skill lists (10-50 skills); scales linearly with skill count
- **Lazy Evaluation:** explainTransfer() allows UI to lazy-load detailed explanations only when user requests them

## Security Considerations
- **API Key Protection:** All AI calls routed through server-side endpoints; no client-side API key exposure
- **Input Validation:** AI response validation prevents injection of malicious data into application state
- **Timeout Protection:** 30-second timeout prevents resource exhaustion from slow/hanging AI requests
- **No PII in Prompts:** Skill names and role titles contain no personally identifiable information

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
This implementation is required by:
- **Task Group 3.1** (Skill Gap Analysis API Endpoints) - API routes will consume this service
- **Task Group 4.1** (Analysis Wizard Flow) - UI will display transferable skills results
- **Task Group 5.1** (E2E Integration Testing) - E2E tests will verify AI fallback behavior

## Notes
1. **Design Decision - Server-Side API Routes:** The service delegates to API routes rather than calling Anthropic directly. This protects API keys and allows rate limiting/monitoring at the API layer.

2. **Design Decision - Confidence Scoring Formula:** The 30/50/20 weight distribution (level/applicability/explanation) was chosen to prioritize applicability to target role while still considering current skill level and explanation quality.

3. **Design Decision - Baseline Algorithm:** Jaccard similarity for skill matching provides good results for technical skills (e.g., "JavaScript" vs "TypeScript") while avoiding false positives on dissimilar skills.

4. **Future Enhancement:** Consider adding skill embeddings (vector similarity) for more sophisticated semantic matching beyond string similarity.

5. **Testing Strategy:** The 8 tests focus on critical integration points (AI prompt construction, response parsing, fallback logic) rather than exhaustive edge case coverage, aligning with the "2-8 focused tests" guidance in the spec.
