## Technical Milestones

### Database Schema (Week 1)
```typescript
// Core data structures with vendor abstraction
interface Resume {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  personalInfo: PersonalInfo;
  experience: Experience[];
  skills: Skill[];
  education: Education[];
  projects: Project[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface JobPosting {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  title: string;
  company: string;
  description: string;
  requirements: string[];
  skills: string[];
  experienceLevel: string;
  location: string;
  bookmarkedAt: Date;
}

interface DevelopmentPlan {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  targetRoleId: string; // References a role from user's targetRoles array
  skillsToDevelop: SkillGap[];
  projectsToBuild: Project[];
  timeline: Timeline;
  progress: Progress;
}
```

### Vendor Abstraction Implementation (Week 1-2)
```typescript
// Service factory configuration
const config: ServiceConfig = {
  database: { provider: 'convex' },
  fileStorage: { provider: 'convex' },
  analysis: { provider: 'openai' },
  realTime: { provider: 'convex' },
  auth: { provider: 'clerk' }
};

// Vendor-agnostic service usage
const factory = new ServiceFactory(config);
const db = await factory.createDatabaseProvider();
const analysis = await factory.createAnalysisEngine();
```
