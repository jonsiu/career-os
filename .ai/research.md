- **Industry-specific progression patterns** (Job requirements approach)

### 3. Skills Matching Algorithm
Based on research emphasizing skill relevance over duration:
- **Relevance-weighted scoring** (not just presence/absence)
- **Confidence levels** based on evidence in resume
- **Match levels**: excellent, good, partial, missing
- **Generic skills prioritization** (problem-solving, communication, technical)

### 4. Learning Recommendations
Based on research on career development and skill acquisition:
- **Time-to-learn estimates** based on skill complexity
- **Curated learning resources** for skill gaps
