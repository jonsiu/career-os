Ok you misunderstood what I meant by personas. What I mean is that the saas application should know what those personas want and would expect from the user who is the candidate for the role. And therefore know how to prepare their user for the target role they are applying for

Ah, I understand now! The application should embody the perspectives of these different stakeholders to help the user understand what each persona is looking for and prepare accordingly.

## Revised Requirements Understanding

The SaaS application should act **as if it were** these different personas, analyzing the user's resume and preparation from each stakeholder's unique perspective:

### Persona-Based Analysis Framework

#### **Career Coach Perspective**
- "What story does your resume tell about your career progression?"
- "How can we position your experience to align with your target role?"
- "What skills should you develop to be competitive?"
- Focuses on: Career narrative, skill development, long-term positioning

#### **HR Recruiter Perspective** 
- "Will this resume pass our ATS screening?"
- "Does the candidate meet our basic requirements?"
- "How does this candidate compare to our typical applicant pool?"
- Focuses on: ATS compatibility, requirement matching, initial screening criteria

#### **Talent Manager Perspective**
- "Does this candidate have the right competencies for the role?"
- "How well can they demonstrate their impact and results?"
- "What's their potential for growth in this position?"
- Focuses on: Competency assessment, performance indicators, growth potential

#### **Hiring Manager Perspective**
- "Can this person solve the specific problems I'm facing?"
- "Will they fit with my team and company culture?"
- "What questions should I ask to validate their experience?"
- Focuses on: Problem-solving ability, team fit, technical validation

### Application Flow Concept

1. **User uploads resume + target job description(s)**
2. **Each persona analyzes the same resume/job combo differently**
3. **User gets 4 different feedback reports with specific recommendations**
4. **Guided improvement suggestions from each perspective**
5. **Interview prep tailored to what each persona would focus on**

### Key Features by Persona Analysis

#### Resume Analysis
- **Career Coach**: Story flow, career progression logic, skill gaps
- **HR Recruiter**: Keyword optimization, format compliance, requirement checklist
- **Talent Manager**: Quantified achievements, competency evidence, leadership examples  
- **Hiring Manager**: Problem-solving examples, relevant experience depth, cultural fit indicators

#### Interview Preparation
- **Career Coach**: "Tell me about yourself" narrative, career goal alignment
- **HR Recruiter**: Basic qualification questions, salary expectations, availability
- **Talent Manager**: Behavioral questions (STAR method), competency-based scenarios
- **Hiring Manager**: Technical deep-dives, situational problem-solving, team dynamics

Does this capture what you had in mind? The application essentially provides a 360-degree view of how different stakeholders in the hiring process would evaluate the user?
