## Prioritization Principles

1. **Career Transition Impact First** - Features that directly help users successfully transition (skill development, experience translation, credibility building) take priority over generic job search features
2. **Growth Over Transactions** - Prioritize features that support continuous development over one-time optimizations. Focus on transformational outcomes, not just transactional wins.
3. **Build-for-Yourself Testing** - All features should be dogfooded for personal career transitions before scaling. If it doesn't help the founder transition careers, it won't help users.
4. **Data Network Effects** - Features that improve with more transition data (timelines, success stories, skill demand trends) create sustainable competitive advantages
5. **Affiliate Revenue Alignment** - Features that drive skill development and course engagement align business model with user success
6. **Technical Foundation** - Provider abstraction and research-backed analysis must remain solid before adding advanced features
